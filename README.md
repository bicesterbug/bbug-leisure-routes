Welcome to the Bicester Leisure Routes (BLR) documentation.

This documentation is aimed at contributers and developers who want to use or improve on the BLR project.
If you're a cyclist want to try out the routes, then the best place to find out more is on the BicesterBUG website: [BicesterBUG.org](https://bicesterbug.org)

The BLR project was devised by BicesterBUG as a way to help residents to discover some of the great cycle paths
that are available in Bicester. Some of these are not well signposted but offer a much safer, faster and more pleasant
way to get between neighbourhoods.

The project has been funded by Active Oxfordshire, enabling the initial website development, flyer design, marketing,
insurance and other associated costs.
